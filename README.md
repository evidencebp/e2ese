# e2ese

The goal of this repository is to enable End to End Software Engineering research.
It started in the source code as input and provide multiple process metrics that can be used as concepts in supervised learning.

While pridcitve models have value, we would like to take a step further and look for causal relations.
For that we provide the source code in different dates.
That enables using co-change analysis in order to identify likely causal relations.
The source code also provides intervention points, were one can use the classical experimental methodology.

This repository contains the source code needed for the generation and some auxaliry data.

The main data is in different repositories since their volum is very large the sturcture is rather similar.
The first batch of 1.8 million Java files from June 2021 is [here](https://github.com/evidencebp/e2ese-dataset)
